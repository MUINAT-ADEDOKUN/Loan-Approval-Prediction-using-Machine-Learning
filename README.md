# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details using various classification models like Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
Dataset

Dataset: `LoanApprovalPrediction.csv`  
Includes applicant details such as gender, income, education, loan amount, credit history, etc.
